# C-Graph-Library-with-Generic-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Developed a C++ graph library that employs the concept of generics through templated data structures and algorithms. The
library contains a comprehensive collection of graph-related functionalities. It includes classic graph algorithms such as graph
coloring, edge coloring, Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning trees (MST), Kruskal’s algorithm, and iterative Depth First
Search(DFS). The library can adapt to diverse data types, facilitating the manipulation of graphs with varying structures and
content.
